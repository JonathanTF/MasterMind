# Mastermind

This is a bonus project for 422c Software Engineering 2. 

To run the jar file you must have java runtime enviornment installed (1.8 or higher recommended). Then you can simply double click on MasterMind.jar, or open a terminal and run 'java -jar MasterMind.jar'.

Initially a window will open up and you can select options for the game. The default settings are for a typical game, but you can make the game easier or harder by adjusting the settings. Then you can start the game by pressing ok.
follow the directions located on the right panel to play. When you win or lose you can hit 'play again' which will bring up the settings window again, where after you hit ok to start a new game with those settings.
press close at any time to quit the game. 

The folder contains all the pictures necessary to run the game. Leaving them out will cause the program to crash. The game takes place entirely in the GUI.
The source files are avialble in src/ for one to see exactly how the game is programmed. The main is located in Driver.java. From here a board is set up with the settings the user gives. Display.java is used to output the status of the board to the GUI. Initiate.java sets up the input boxes and text that remain throughout the duration of a game. The Driver updates components and handles the state of the game as it progresses.

# How to Play

In this game you must crack the code that is generated by the computer by guessing what it is, and through hints you recieve with each guess. This code is a sequence of 4 colors, which can be blue, green, orange, purple, red, or yellow. You get a set number of rounds, each of which you are allowed one guess. After you guess a panel on the right will tell you some information about your previous guess. In the hint panel you recieve a black peg for each guess that is exactly correct (color and position) and a white peg for each guess that is only correct in color, not in position. The actual sequence of these hint pegs don't have any meaning. Your goal is to get 4 black pegs before your guesses are up.
